You can download it from [Releases](https://github.com/SuperZombi/fast-server/releases).
* If you want to automatically add the "Run Server" command to the context menu, download the `FastServer_installer`.
* If you want to launch the program manually, download the `HTTPServer.exe` file.

The server automatically hosts files from the folder in which it was called.

To change the settings or turn off the server, find the icon in the tray menu.
